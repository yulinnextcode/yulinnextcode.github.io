This post will guide you details about Azure AI Search.

## Overview
Azure AI Search (formerly known as "Azure Cognitive Search") is an enterprise-ready search and retrieval system, with a comprehensive set of advanced search technologies, built for high-performance applications at any scale.

Azure AI Search is the recommended retrieval system for building RAG-based applications on Azure, with native LLM integrations between Azure OpenAI Service and Azure Machine Learning, and multiple strategies for relevance tuning.

Azure AI Search can be used in both traditional and GenAI scenarios. Common use cases include knowledge base insights (catalog or document search), information discovery (data exploration), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and indexing automation.

Architecturally, a search service sits between the external data stores that contain your un-indexed data, and your client app that sends query requests to a search index and handles the response.

Across the Azure platform, Azure AI Search can integrate with other Azure services in the form of indexers that automate data ingestion/retrieval from Azure data sources, and skillsets that incorporate consumable AI from Azure AI services, such as image and natural language processing, or custom AI that you create in Azure Machine Learning or wrap inside Azure Functions.
